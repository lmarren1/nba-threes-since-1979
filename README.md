## Purpose

This shiny app is designed to give NBA 'stat fanatics' a medium to interact with player 
3-point data in ways typically unavailable on major NBA statistics channels 
(e.g. ESPN, StatMuse, Basketball-Reference, etc.). Users can investigate 
3-point statistics on over 3000 NBA players since the birth of the 3-point line.
With customizable inputs for 3-point data by game, season, and over a player's 
career, this app can be used to uncover otherwise hidden player 3-point data
trends and insights.

## Usage 

The following packages are required for the [app.R](app.R) and [R/functions.R](R/functions.R) files to run:
- dplyr
- tidyverse
- ggthemes
- ggplot2
- shiny
- shinyWidgets
- shinyFeedback

To install these packages, you can simply run: install.package("package name here")

## Other Notes

I am currently looking for a summer internship/job in the Chicagoland 
area for data science/analytics/SWE positions. Feel free to contact me with job 
referrals/inquiries via my LinkedIn or email.
